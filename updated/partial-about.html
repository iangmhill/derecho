	<h3> <b> <u> Stack Overflow (Sophia) </u> </b></h3>

		<img src="images/stackoverflow.png" alt="stackoverflow" style="width:500px;height:364px;">

		<p> We are inspired by stackoverflow (and generally all of the stackexchange collection of websites) because of the low barrier to information that it enables. If someone has a question about code, or anything else for that matter, they can likely look up the answer on stackoverflow, or a sister site. If they cannot find the answer to the question, then they can simply ask the question, and it will be often be answered relatively quickly by people who are genuinely trying to help others who might know less than they do. Although there are occasionally people who are mean, stackoverflow very much encourages people helping eachother.</p>

		<p> We would like to have the same low barrier to information in our tool. We want it to be as easy to find any information about where people are living and the possible hallway culture as it is to find any information about a bug on stackoverflow.  Additionally, while we cannot prevent people from being mean to eachother during the room draw process,we would like to encourage the same helpful, collaborative spirt in our tool. </p>

	<h3> <b> <u> Room Draw Planning Spreadsheet (Sophia) </u> </b></h3>
  		<p> Currently, this is one of the methods of communication that Olin students use to help facilitate the planning of room draw. Although this spreadsheet is typically used mostly to plan who people are living with, some groups, especially those in suites also use to figure out who has expressed a preliminary interest in living where and what culture each suite might be thinking about having. We want to make sure that our room draw tool facilitates the same inital expression of interest in suites, especially multiple possible locations as is enabled in this spreasheet. <p>

	<h3> <b> <u> Seat Reservation on Airline Websites (Sophia) </u> </b></h3>
  		<p> When checking in for a flight, some airlines allow you to choose your seat on the airplane. The interface is not cluttered, and it is clear what seats have special qualities, like being an exit row or a seat with more leg room. In our room draw tool, we want it to be just as easy to see qualities, like loudness, of a hallway as it is to tell information about a particular seat in the airline check in process. <p>

	<h3> <b> <u> Mint Bills (Sophia) </u> </b></h3>
  		<p> Mint Bills allows users to pay all their bills from a single app, as opposed to using a different app to pay every bill a user has. Currently, during the room draw process, people use many different means of communication, including, email, face-to-face, and pin boards, among others. We want our tool to reduce the different mediums of communication that people use to communicate about room draw and have them in one, consolidated place. <p>

	<h3> <b> <u> The First Iteration of a Class (Sophia) </u> </b></h3>
  		<p> At Olin, everyone knows that the first iteration of a class will not be perfect, but that with enough feedback, and open channels of communication, everything will be okay. We would like our room draw tool to encourage the same attitude. <p>
