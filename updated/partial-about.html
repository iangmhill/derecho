  <p> Stack Overflow (Sophia)
We are inspired by Stackoverflow because of the collaborative culture that the site has created. On this site, people work together to answer questions of people who are less experienced with code than they are. Although, you do get the occasional person being mean, the general spirit of people on this website is helpful. We would also like to encourage helpful spirit on our product. 
Additionally, Stackoverflow provides an easy way to access, or get information that people need. If a user has a question, they can often find the answer on the website. If not, they can ask the question, and the question is often answered quickly. We would like to encourage this same transparency, and low barrier to relevant information when we create a room draw tool. We want it to be just as easy to get information on culture and who is thinking about living where as it is to find information using the combination of stackoverflow/google.
