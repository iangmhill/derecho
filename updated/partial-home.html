<h2>Project Brief</h2>
</center>
<p>During Room Draw at Olin every year, students become increasingly frustrated with each other and the Room Draw Committee because of poor communication. The current interface for suites and doubles to communicate their intent to room in a certain location is completely physical - students place pins on maps of the dorms. The high activation energy to check for and address conflicts slows communication and causes important conversations to be delayed or brushed under the rug.
Hallway culture is a major part of room draw conversations but there is no easily accessible method for making those discussions known and the intent of a certain group of students clear. At present, students can only speculate as to the culture of a hallway based their knowledge of the students planning to live in those hallways.
Our project will facilitate earlier, clearer communication for rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors in Olinâ€™s room draw in order to alleviate tensions and prevent miscommunications.t</p>
