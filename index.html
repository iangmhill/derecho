              <h4>Project Brief</h4>
              <p>
              During Room Draw at Olin every year, students become increasingly frustrated with each other and the Room Draw Committee because of poor communication. The current interface for suites and doubles to communicate their intent to room in a certain location is completely physical - students place pins on maps of the dorms. The high activation energy to check for and address conflicts slows communication and causes important conversations to be delayed or brushed under the rug.
              </p>
              <p>
              Hallway culture is a major part of room draw conversations but there is no easily accessible method for making those discussions known and the intent of a certain group of students clear. At present, students can only speculate as to the culture of a hallway based their knowledge of the students planning to live in those hallways.
              </p>
              <p>
              Our project will facilitate earlier, clearer communication for rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors in Olin’s room draw in order to alleviate tensions and prevent miscommunications.
              </p>
              <p>
              A very rough possible implementation of this project can be found in the sketch below.
              </p>
              <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp float-image">
                <img src="images/projectbriefsketch.jpg" width="400px"/>
              </div>
              <p>
              In the sketch, there is an interactive map of one floor of the dorm, chats of hallways that the user is interested in living in, and a profile of each of the suites/hallways that a user can click on. The profiles of suites and hallways might contain information like how loud the suite is, and whether they are planning on partying. Additionally, a user can navigate between dorms and floors using the buttons on the bottom left corner.
              </p>
              <p>
              As we design the tool, we will be reaching out to past members of the Room Draw Committee and students who have participated in Room Draw to better understand their pain points with the current system. In conversations with participants, we will learn how students currently approach room draw and how our project could address their concerns.
              </p>
              <p>
              Our target users are all around us, and we can collect stories and frustrations in person and through anonymous surveys.
              </p>
              <p>
              The Derecho team includes students who have been room draw participants and one who has been a member of the Room Draw Committee. We have access to two cars which could allow us to interview students and administrators at other schools with different Room Draw systems and policies.
              </p>
              <p>
              Our team consists of two people who have experience in web app creation, Austin and Tenzin, and two people who would like to learn how to build web apps, Ian and Sophia. Since Ian and Sophia would both like experience with building web apps, the two of them will lead the software portion of this project. Austin and Tenzin both would like focus more on the design portion of this project and will lead that effort. That being said, everybody will be involved in each portion of the project, but two team members will lead each portion of the project.

                <h4>Pin Boards (Austin)</h4>
                The pin boards are the current formal medium for communicating preferred double and suite preference. By physically placing pins students can make their intents clear and they make the spacial arrangement of rooms readily apparent. The flaws of this system serve as equally if not stronger inspiration. The boards are hosted on the second floor of the CC. This leads to both infrequent updating of the boards and a latency between them being updating and that information being disseminated.

                <h4>C to Python Transition (Austin)</h4>
                C is a powerful but low level programming that requires programmers to keep track of memory and other values in ways that can be unintuitive. Python is a higher level language that sacrifices speed for easing of writing. Transitioning from writing C to writing Python, everything makes total sense immediately and programmers feel empowered by the speed at which they can fly through code that use to take much longer to write. We want moving from the old room draw process to ours to feel similarly liberating.

                Google Plus uses “circles” to organize and label groups of friends. While very different from a social network, our product could use a similar interface to organize students into suites and doubles and make students’ rooming intentions clear. Students in circles representing suites could start discussions together to decide whether to invite other members to the suite and consider the suite’s location.

                Many room draw conversations currently occur over email, and we believe that the written records provided by email are useful in the room draw process; however, email communication can be slow, and it can be difficult to describe hallway culture or a particular dorm location. Email inspired us to make our product better than email.

                In high stakes rooming discussions, students want to talk to each other quickly without having to wait for a face to face interaction. Facebook’s personal messaging system allows for groups to communicate quickly and easily. Within seconds, a user can add the relevant people to a discussion and start sending messages. Our product ought to support some type of multi-student communication tool to facilitate rooming discussions.

                <h4>Stack Overflow (Sophia)</h4>
                We are inspired by stackoverflow (and generally all of the stackexchange collection of websites) because of the low barrier to information that it enables. If someone has a question about code, or anything else for that matter, they can likely look up the answer on stackoverflow, or a sister site. If they cannot find the answer to the question, then they can simply ask the question, and it will be often be answered relatively quickly by people who are genuinely trying to help others who might know less than they do. Although there are occasionally people who are mean, stackoverflow very much encourages people helping each other.
                </br></br>
                We would like to have the same low barrier to information in our tool. We want it to be as easy to find any information about where people are living and the possible hallway culture as it is to find any information about a bug on stackoverflow. Additionally, while we cannot prevent people from being mean to each other during the room draw process,we would like to encourage the same helpful, collaborative spirit in our tool.

                Currently, this is one of the methods of communication that Olin students use to help facilitate the planning of room draw. Although this spreadsheet is typically used mostly to plan who people are living with, some groups, especially those in suites also use to figure out who has expressed a preliminary interest in living where and what culture each suite might be thinking about having. We want to make sure that our room draw tool facilitates the same initial expression of interest in suites, especially multiple possible locations as is enabled in this spreadsheet.

The interface is not cluttered, and it is clear what seats have special qualities, like being an exit row or a seat with more leg room. In our room draw tool, we want it to be just as easy to see qualities, like loudness, of a hallway as it is to tell information about a particular seat in the airline check in process.

Currently, during the room draw process, people use many different means of communication, including, email, face-to-face, and pin boards, among others. We want our tool to reduce the different mediums of communication that people use to communicate about room draw and have them in one, consolidated place.

                </br></br>
                Currently, there are instances where students were unaware of the culture of people they would be living close to until after the room draw processes.

We will facilitate people to have the privacy of face-to-face communications with our tool by allowing our users to choose to only chat with certain people and since we believe that this method of communication is an essential component of the room draw process, we hope that our tool will encourage people to have more face-to-face communications by making them aware of students who have the same preferences as them.

                <h4>Wikipedia (Tenzin)</h4>
                Like wikipedia, majority of the content of our product will be produced by the users. The users of our product will be the ones who provide information about their interests in where they want to live and the kind of hallway culture they want. They are also the ones who will be using the information on the site to influence their final decision on the room draw process. While wikipedia is the first site people generally think of visiting to find information on any topic, we hope that our product will be a place where students will visit to find any information information on the site to influence their final decision on the room draw process.

                <h4>iPhone (Tenzin)</h4>
                iPhones are generally easier to use and the user interface is more intuitive than android phones. Though Iphones have multiple features and users also demand more features, one of Apple’s main goal is to create products that customers can learn by themselves and they managed to keep the Iphone interface largely simple, which has contributed to the product’s popularity. While our tool will include multiple features to facilitate a smoother room draw process, one of our main objective is to ensure that students will find our product easy to use.

              <h4>Needs Analysis</h4>

              <h5>The Problem</h5>

              <p>
                What does it mean for something to be “Olin-esque?” If one were to ask Oliners, one would hear many different answers to this question. Some students will quote the Honor Code while others cite their experiences in class, but consistently, the Olin community values cooperation, communication, and respect for others.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every year, our current process for assigning students to dorm rooms invites students to abandon one or more of these values. We call this process Room Draw. In such a close knit community, students care deeply about who they will be rooming with and near. Students look forward to planning suites and hallways with their friends around a certain culture or theme, and they get emotionally attached to plans and potential futures. This high stress situation makes communicating intentions absolutely critical.
              </p>
              <p>
                As an elegant and intuitive communication tool, our project aims to encourage collaboration by facilitating early communication. Through better communication, students can better understand each other’s intentions and resolve potential conflicts in a respectful and thoughtful way.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the room draw process, we have identified three different stages: people deciding who they want to room with within a suite or double, people deciding who they are living with, and finally the stage where everything becomes official, and student life is in charge of placing remaining stragglers. A diagram of these stages can be seen below:
              </p>
            </div>

              <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-shadow--2dp" style="margin:20px 0 30px 0;">
                <img src="images/three_phases.jpg" width="100%"/>
              </div>

            <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">
              <p>
                Of these three stages, we are focusing on the second stage -- where students decide where they are living. In this stage, students generally know who their room/suitemates are, but have not finalized a dorm, hallway, or room. We have chosen this stage of the room draw process because in the first stage, many of the conversations can, and do, happen offline. In the second stage, however, we have the opportunity to make communication more open and have lower latency. Conversations about culture and where people are interested in living concern multiple suites and doubles, and we would like to provide a communication and planning tool to facilitate these conversations.
              </p>

              <h4>Which Campuses Matter?</h4>

              <p>
                Although students at many campuses participate in room draw, we have elected not to make a room draw tool that aims to work for many different universities. There are multiple reasons that we have made this decision. The first reason is that room draw policies vary for every institution, and Olin’s room draw policy is very unique. At Wellesley and Harvey Mudd, for example all students or groups of students that are planning on living together receive a distinct rank, or order for their room draw process. In other words, every group of students knows exactly which other students outrank them and which they outrank. In this case, there is less room for communication -- people are not likely to compromise and communicate if they know immediately which person could take a contested room because of their rank. On the other hand, at Olin, room draw ranking is puts doubles and suites into groups where no double or suite knows the ranking of all the people within that group. This is possible because of Olin’s small size; at any larger school this would be a logistical nightmare. In Olin’s case, where there is no apparent winner for a contested space, communication and compromise are encouraged and required. While a planning tool that better enables communication for room draw might not be useless at an institution where the room draw policy does not encourage communication and compromise, the tool we plan to build would certainly be more useful at an institution like Olin. 
              </p>
              <a href="images/current_process.jpg">
                <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp float-image">
                  <img src="images/current_process.jpg" width="400px"/>
                </div>
              </a>
              <p>
                Additionally, at many other schools, the room draw process is very condensed -- while Olin’s room draw process lasts for months. At other schools, there is simply not enough time for the conversations that our tool would enable to play out. At these institutions, after rankings are assigned and students are told which residence hall they are living in (often decided by student life administrators using a combination of students’ class year, previous residence hall and space left in the desired residence hall) there is one night where students can select the room they are living in. Before this night, unlike at Olin, it is not expected that a preference for a specific room is made public. In fact, at some schools, some rooms or residence halls are so much prefered that students scheme to get themselves and their friends into a specific hall or room. In cases like these communication is very much discouraged. In this case, a tool for making room draw a more communication friendly process would be entirely unhelpful, and designing a communication tool for such a case would be a waste of time. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, we have heard in our conversations with students from different schools that their dorm culture is somewhat equivalent to our hallway culture. This means that, at another school, living in the “right” dorm is much more important than living the the “right” room or hallway within that dorm. At Olin, almost the opposite is true -- the dorm does matter, but it is incredibly important for students to be living in the “right” hallway with all their friends. Everything related to room draw at Olin is on a micro scale with many emotions confined to a small space. Here it is easy to blame other people as opposed to the system and this makes a room draw tool customized to Olin valuable.
              </p>

              <h4>Who Matters?</h4>

              <p>
                Because Olin’s room draw process is so unique, this product will be aimed at only Olin students who participate in the room draw process. This excludes Olin students who are R2s as well as those who have not found a suite/room mate before the suite and double selection deadlines. In our conversations around the room draw process, we have found that there are four distinct types of users. 
              </p>
              <ul class="">
                <h5>Hallway Organizer (Example: Ruth)</h5>
                <p>
                  These students are in charge of a group of either suites or doubles. They take on responsibility for organizing and placing groups of students.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the room draw process, hallway organizers are stressed out. They not only have the responsibility of one room or suite during room draw, but sometimes an entire hallway that is focused on living together. This means that they not only have to keep tabs on what other hallway organizers are doing, but also other independents who might have more points than any member of the group they are organizing. Their entire plan can be derailed with one unanticipated pin placement, and hallway organizers are very worried that this will happen in the room draw process.
                </p>

                <h5>Hallway Member (Example: Shep)</h5>
                <p>
                  These are students that are a part of a larger hallway organization -- a group of friends all planning on living together. These students are just planning on living where their hallway boss tells them to. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the room draw process, hallway members are relatively relaxed -- they know that they’ll be living in a hallway with their friends, with the culture that they want, and there’s someone else in charge of organizing this. Although they do care about living with their friends, they also know that someone else is responsible for organizing this.
                </p>

                <h5>Disengaged</h5>
                <p>
                  These people are not engaged in the room draw process at all. They do not care who they are living with and where they are living. They are not a part of a group that wants to live together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the room draw process, disengaged members go with the flow. They may never lock in a roommate or go through the normal room draw process. As long as they wind up with a room before the semester starts, they are not concerned.
                </p>

                <h5>Passionate Independent</h5>
                <p>
                  These students do care very much about where they are living or the culture of their hallway, but are not a part of a group.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These students may have been kicked out of a hallway group or suite due to size constraints or care strongly about some outside factor. This factors include, but aren’t limited to, proximity to first years, sound, alcohol culture, natural lighting, proximity to friends, distance from enemies, ceiling height, and floor level.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After identifying these four distinct types of users, we have fleshed out these types to create personas. A chart of our personas can be seen below:
                </p>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-shadow--2dp" style="margin:20px 0 30px 0;">
              <a href="images/personas.jpg">
                <img src="images/personas.jpg" width="100%"/>
              </a>
            </div>

            <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">
              <p>
                In designing this tool, we know that we need to satisfy Nancy, the passionate independent. She cares very much about the culture of her hallway and the people who are living in her hallway, but does not have a specific group of people she plans to live with. If she were planning on living with a group, then many of the conversations about hallway culture could happen offline and simply be reported online. Nancy, however, has no access to information about hallway culture, and will have to resort to asking everyone who could possibly be living in the same area as she is, and might not get the responses she needs; she simply does not have the offline communication that someone living in a hallway group does. At the same time, though, we need to make sure we also satisfy Dylan. He needs the new room draw tool to not add any work to his plate that he does not even care about. While Shep and Ruth can have conversations about culture with their respective hallway groups, it is vital that they are able to make their intents for rooms and requirements for hallway culture known, so that they can make sure that their group does not get split. For example, Ruth might be very concerned with finding an appropriate double to fill out the party hallway she is planing, and Shep’s group is concerned about finding a quiet suite to share their hallway. 
              </p>

              <h4>Requirements</h4>
              <p>
                As a result of our conversations with users, and discussion of our types of users, we have narrowed down the following requirements: 
              </p>
              <p>
                First and foremost, rising sophomores, juniors and seniors should be able to use the tool to indicate which rooms they are interested in as well as to gauge other students’ preferences for doubles or suites in East Hall or West Hall. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, in interviews with our users we found that hallway culture is one of the most important parameters people use to select where they are living. Ruth, Shep, and Nancy are all highly concerned about their hallway culture. As a result, our solution should allow people to view and submit preferences in hallway culture. Currently, there is no easily accessible method for making discussions on hallway culture known and the intent of a certain group of students clear.  Indicating hallway culture will allow users to view and state their lifestyle such as when they prefer to sleep and how loud they are as well as their preferred drinking culture.  They could also share their ideas on activities their hallway can do.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similarly, we want to enable an open conversation about hallway culture. While in a group, conversations about hallway culture might happen offline and might be decided by the time room draw officially happens, Nancy and other passionate independents living together might not have as clear and cohesive an idea of the hallway culture that they want. We also need to enable and store these conversations in a centralized place, so that prospective members of a hallway can engage in chats to gauge if a particular hallway is for them. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Another requirement is that users are free to engage -- or not -- in whatever portions of the room draw tool that they want to. We do not want to alienate Dylan and the disengaged room draw participants or other people who do not feel comfortable stating information. Similarly, it is important that the entire room draw planning tool is not disrupted by a few users choosing to not engage with every feature of the tool.
              </p>

              <h4>Impact of a Successful Solution</h4>

              <p>
                We realize that the goal of this class is not to make a prototype that actually works, but if we design a successful and approachable user experience, we will make an effort to build a fully functioning prototype of our product.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a world where Oliners use our tool to improve communication around Room Draw, students are rarely surprised to learn of conflicts over rooms. Room Draw no longer causes grudges and stress, and students approach the process confident that the outcome will be agreeable. Every Oliner is invested in making sure their peers are happy where they are rooming, and everyone looks out for eachother.

              <h5> The Design </h5>
                <p>
                  We designed a the interface for a web application to improve the experience around Olin’s Room Draw process. Students would be able to sign in using their network credentials and begin communicating their intentions around room draw.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <i>Map and Browsing:</i> Crafting a user experience to enhance the communication process around Olin’s Room Draw, we acknowledged that students, under the current process, are used to placing a physical pin into a piece of foam core with a map of each dorm printed on it. Although we considered a more abstract representations of Olin’s dorms and rooms in an effort to convey additional information and insights, we settled on placing the familiar dorm floor maps as the center of our design.
                </p>

                <a href="images/designdevelopment/Derecho_Prototype_Neutral.jpg">
                  <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp float-image" style="width: 400px">
                    <img src="images/designdevelopment/Derecho_Prototype_Neutral.jpg" style="width: 100%"/>
                    <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
                      The user will see this page when they first log onto the web app. Notice that neutral tags are already populated on the left side of the page and the menu bar at the top of the screen allows a user to navigate through the each floor of the dorms at Olin.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </a>

                <p>
                  Using the menu bar at the top of the screen, users can browse through the different dorm floors and get a sense of where other roommate pairs and suites have placed their pins. If a user hovers over a room where a pin has been placed, a small pop-up a appears telling the user who placed their pin in that room.
                </p>

                <a href="images/designdevelopment/Derecho_Prototype_Hover.jpg">
                  <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp float-image" style="width: 400px">
                    <img src="images/designdevelopment/Derecho_Prototype_Hover.jpg" style="width: 100%"/>
                    <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
                      When navigating around the floor maps, user can hover over rooms to immediately see who has put a pin in a room.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </a>

                <p>
                  <i>Tags:</i> An easily accessible and familiar map proved to be approachable for our users, but in order to really improve and add value to the process, our tool also needed to communicate additional information and make preferences more transparent.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To convey additional information, our design includes user created tags for rooms and suites. Tags that other have created are displayed in grayscale on the left side of the page from the time the user first logs on. Room or suite captain can weigh in on these tags indicating their room or suite’s preference around each of the tags as well as the relative importance of each preference. For example, a suite captain may drag the slider for “partying” all the way to the right to indicate that the members of the suite <b>strongly like</b> partying. Conversely a double captain may drag the slider for “messiness” only one tick to the left indicating that the members of the double somewhat avoid messiness.
                </p>

                <a href="images/designdevelopment/Derecho_Prototype_Partial.jpg">
                  <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp float-image" style="width: 400px">
                    <img src="images/designdevelopment/Derecho_Prototype_Partial_Tags.jpg" style="width: 100%"/>
                    <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
                      When a user expresses a preference for a tag, it floats up to the top portion of the list and is ranked by preference from <b>like </b> to <b>avoid.</b> Additionally, a heat map of net agreement or disagreement with the tags updates on the map. In this case, blue would indicate higher agreement, and orange would indicate higher conflict. White would indicate no conflict, but also no agreement.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </a>
                

                <p>
                  If a user selects another room, there is a button in the lower right hand corner which allows users to compare the user’s tag preferences to those of another room or suite. To show this, colored indicators are overlaid on the tag sliders to represent the preference of the room or suite being inspected.
                </p>

                <a href="mages/designdevelopment/Derecho_Prototype_Compare.jpg">
                  <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp float-image" style="width: 400px">
                    <img src="images/designdevelopment/Derecho_Prototype_Comparison.jpg" style="width: 100%"/>
                    <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
                      When comparing preferences with another room, notice that blue indicators have appeared to express the preferences of the room being compared.

                  </div>
                </a>

                <p> 
                  <i>Map Overlay:</i> The comparison tool is useful for comparing against individual rooms, but it does not allow a user to compare against an entire floor or hallway all at once. A heat map like overlay will allow this more meta level comparison. In the default state, the overlay will show the total tag ranking difference updating in real time as the user ranks more tags. This will allow users to, at a glance, see which areas have similar preferences and culture to them and which do not. upon selecting a tag the overlay will switch to show a heat map of that tag in particular, allowing for a more detailed inspection of cultural trends.
                </p>

              <h5> Benefits and Drawbacks of our Design </h5>
                <p>
                  We have recognized a variety of user needs throughout our process. These range from the basic selecting a room, to the more nuanced, making individual and group culture more transparent and facilitating discussion. Firstly, our design has all of the basic functions of the current solution, the pinboard, people are able to select rooms easily and the latency of the analog solution is minimized. With this design you can see changes in real time instead of having to trek to the campus center. Our dynamic tagging system excels at allowing users to put forward a snapshot of their individual culture and the culture they would like around them. Our heatmap and comparison functions make it easy for users to see both in fine detail and in the aggregate the culture and attitudes of the dorms. By focusing so much on the culture piece of the room draw puzzle though, this design relegates facilitating discussion to the background. We include a way to send messages to other room draw participants but nothing more. We hope that by exposing culture preferences, people will be activate to have face to face conversations to pre-empt conflicts but we leave the impetus for these discussions on the users.
                </p>
              <h5> Why  we're confident in this idea (The other things we tried) </h5>
                <p>
                  Before narrowing down on the idea that we described above, we investigated three possible design directions. We created these design directions by identifying themes around what our users view as important. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  <u>Providing information about the big picture of who is living where</u>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This design direction focuses on giving people as much information about who is living where as possible. One possible design interaction can be seen below.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-shadow--2dp" style="margin:20px 0 30px 0;">
              <a href="images/designdevelopment/BigPicture.jpg">
                <img src="images/designdevelopment/BigPicture.jpg" width="100%"/>
              </a>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>
                In this design direction, we aimed to capture the idea that being able to visualize room draw on the dorm-level as opposed to a floor or hallway level would provide added value. Here, we want users to be able to not only be able to see how multiple floors are shaping up, but also be able to see easily who is living above or below them. Afterall, loud upstairs neighbors might be more annoying than loud neighbors across the hall. One possible interface we briefly investigated for this design direction is the “bubble map” visualization. 
              </p>
            </div>

            <a href="images/designdevelopment/Bubbles.jpg">
              <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp float-image" style="width: 400px">
                <img src="images/designdevelopment/Bubbles.jpg" style="width: 100%"/>
              </div>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>
                Although this is not a complete map of a dorm, this interface would allow a user interested in living in the West hallway on the 2nd floor to easily see who is planning on living in their chosen hallway, as well as the other hallways on their floor and the hallways above or below their second hallway.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a few main reasons that we did not move further than initial sketches of possible interfaces with this design direction. Although presenting information in a different way is an intriguing idea, there is little added value. In the current room draw process, people can access this information already. We are just reshuffling the information that already exists to display it in a different way. Although a tool that makes seeing the big picture of who is living where might be useful for someone like Ruth the Hallway Organizer (see personas from last phase) Nancy the Passionate Independent might not like this tool as much. Although she likes the idea of being able to see who is around her, she also cares a lot about the culture of the hallway she lives in, and this tool puts culture in the back seat in preference of visualizing data. Additionally, big picture information is not useful to people like Shep or Dylan who are not very engaged in this part of the room draw process, and having to navigate through the big picture information to select a room would frustrate them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <u>Facilitating communication about who wants to live where</u>
              </p>
              <p>
                Another of our design directions is facilitating communication around who wants to live where. A tool in this design direction would focus on making it easy to have conversations between people interested in living in/on the same floor, hallway, or room. Since our goal was to improve communication around the room draw process, this is perhaps the most obvious design direction, and the process for this particular direction is relatively simple. 
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-shadow--2dp" style="margin:20px 0 30px 0;">
              <a href="images/designdevelopment/Communication.jpg">
                <img src="images/designdevelopment/Communication.jpg" width="100%"/>
              </a>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>
                As can be seen in the brief process diagram above, the process in a case centered around communication might involve navigating through a map of the different floors of a particular dorm, selecting a room that the user is interested in living in. If others are also interested in living in the same room, then users engage in a conversation about who gets the room, which will eventually end with one person getting the room and others having to find new rooms. Once a person has selected a room, they would be automatically added to public chats with all the current members of the hallway that other prospective members of the hallway could see. One possible implementation of this can be seen below:
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <a href="images/designdevelopment/MessageMap.jpg">
              <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp float-image" style="width: 400px">
                <img src="images/designdevelopment/MessageMap.jpg" style="width: 100%"/>
              </div>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>
                We did not choose to pursue this design direction because we felt that it was too straightforward. There was an easily implementable solution, but we felt that this direction was not particularly innovative -- simply a digital representation of the current pin board process Olin has. For the purposes of this class, we felt that we could learn much more pursing our third design direction. Additionally, a system built around communication does not work for people like our Shep and Dylan personas who are not interested in communicating at all. This type of design would be frustrating for people trying to communicate with the Sheps and Dylans of room draw, and doesn’t necessarily add any value for a Nancy or Ruth who is trying to determine if she or someone else will be a good cultural fit or see how other hallway groups are behaving. 
              </p>

              <p>
                <u>Making sure people are aware of the culture of their living area</u>
              </p>
              <p>
                Our third design direction, and the one we chose to pursue, is culture focused. As described above, in this design direction we are trying to add value by making information about culture that is not easily accessible in the current room draw process easily available to users. Although we landed on the idea of culture “tags” relatively early in the design process the the design interaction changed quite a bit from the early iterations. 
              </p>

              <p>
                At first, we wanted users to sort tags around whether they felt positively or negatively around a certain tag. The paper prototype of an interface for doing this can be seen below:
              </p>
            </div>

            <a href="images/designdevelopment/OriginalTags.jpg">
              <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp float-image" style="width: 400px">
                <img src="images/designdevelopment/OriginalTags.jpg" style="width: 100%"/>
              </div>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>
                In this case, users would have to say that they feel positively about certain tags and negatively about others. In user testing, there was quite a bit of confusion about what what it meant to tag something as negative or positive. For example, does it mean the same thing to feel negatively about parties and to feel negatively about tea? For the purposes of room draw, is one more important? In the end, we decided on the more dimensional approach to ranking tags that lets users rank tags all the way from they can’t live near someone who supports this tag to they need to live near people who support this tag. This will clear up the confusion caused by having people sort tags into just two categories.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another interaction that we spend a lot of time considering is how to visualize what tags a double or suite has in common and one that they disagree on. Our initial way to visualize this was to just show users how others had organized their tags into two grouped and provide some sort of heatmap that reflected net agreement. Pictures of these can be seen below:
              </p>
            </div>

            <a href="images/designdevelopment/Card.jpg">
              <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp float-image" style="width: 400px">
                <img src="images/designdevelopment/Card.jpg" style="width: 100%"/>
              </div>
            </a>

            <a href="images/designdevelopment/Heatmap.jpg">
              <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp float-image" style="width: 400px">
                <img src="images/designdevelopment/Heatmap.jpg" style="width: 100%"/>
              </div>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>
                In this implementation, although users can infer conflicts by knowing how they sorted the tags, and can get a net agreement score, there is no way for users to easily see which tags they agree on. Since being a cultural match is so important for people at Olin, we need to make it easy to see which culture tags are conflicting and which match in a particular situation, especially for tags that especially important to our users. As a result, a design that requires users to infer conflicts and agreements will not meet our users needs.
              </p>
              <h5>Insights Gained</h5>
              <p>
                We learned early on from our user visits as well as from our own experiences that the current room draw process requires better communication. By making information about room draw available early on to students, we feel that we could mitigate frustration during the room draw process by encouraging early conversations and discussions. In addition to location, we found that students’ interest in where they are living can be primarily influenced by hallway culture and other students living around them.  While we decided that it is essential for the tool to display hallway culture as well as who is interested in living where, we realized by trying out different interface designs that the interface design that we decide on could look very different depending on which feature we decide to prioritize. This lead to our discussion on whether we think that the tool would be more useful if the information is presented in a way that allows people to view hallway culture easily or view people who are interested in living nearby. Hence, this exercise allowed us to delve deeper into what exactly do we think is most important and useful for our users to communicate about during room draw. 
              </p>
              <p>
                A feature that was most commonly requested by the students who had tried our paper prototype was the ability to view who had placed their pin in a room when they hover their cursor over it. They wanted a small pop up right next to the room with names of the people who are interested in living in that room. Our initial idea of viewing people interested in a room was clicking on that room, which also allows you to view the button to select that room as well as view the tags of those people. The request made by the students who tried our paper prototype made us realize that while we have been focused our making our tool primarily for indicating culture with the feature to select rooms, students should also have the capability to check who is interested in living around them and this task requires easy access to information. The users complained that clicking each room for browsing will be tedious. While we initially thought that pop ups would be bothersome when users happen to move their cursor over the map, we realized that browsing will be much easier with this feature.

              <h5>Prototype Overview</h5>
              <p>
                Our room draw tool aims to improve the experience around Olin’s room draw process. Students should be able to effectively communicate their intentions around room draw and understand the intentions of other students with less latency than if they were using physical pin boards.
              </p>

              <h5>Your Situation</h5>
              <p>
                You’re a student at Olin College in the midst of the room draw process. It’s mid April and just yesterday roommate pairs were announced and groups by rank. At this time last year, the foam core pin boards where roommate pairs would express their desire for a certain room would have been set up on the Dining Hall Mezzanine, but this year, StAR has opted to use a new electronic room draw communication tool.
              </p>
              <p>
                At this point in the room draw process, roommates pairs have already been locked in. You, Sophia Seitz, know that you will rooming with Tenzin Choetso, and are currently planning on living in an East Hall double. You and Tenzin would like to live in a quiet hallway with fairly minimal partying.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your goal is to understand the culture developing in the dorm and express your intent to live in a certain room which meets your criteria.

              <ul>
                <li>There are the same people living on every floor of East Hall</li>
                <li>We have not created a map of West Hall yet, so when you click on any of the west hall buttons, we display the East Hall data.</li>
                <li>You can, as a double, select to live in a suite.</li>
                <li>“Compare Tags” button which would have allowed you to compare tags with other roommate pairs currently does not function.</li>
                <li>The Home button also currently does nothing. This would take you to the current location of your pin.</li>
                <li>The prototype cannot handle two users contesting the same room.</li>
