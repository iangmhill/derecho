              <h4>Project Brief</h4>
              <p>
              During Room Draw at Olin every year, students become increasingly frustrated with each other and the Room Draw Committee because of poor communication. The current interface for suites and doubles to communicate their intent to room in a certain location is completely physical - students place pins on maps of the dorms. The high activation energy to check for and address conflicts slows communication and causes important conversations to be delayed or brushed under the rug.
              </p>
              <p>
              Hallway culture is a major part of room draw conversations but there is no easily accessible method for making those discussions known and the intent of a certain group of students clear. At present, students can only speculate as to the culture of a hallway based their knowledge of the students planning to live in those hallways.
              </p>
              <p>
              Our project will facilitate earlier, clearer communication for rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors in Olin’s room draw in order to alleviate tensions and prevent miscommunications.
              </p>
              <p>
              A very rough possible implementation of this project can be found in the sketch below.
              </p>
              <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp float-image">
                <img src="images/projectbriefsketch.jpg" width="400px"/>
              </div>
              <p>
              In the sketch, there is an interactive map of one floor of the dorm, chats of hallways that the user is interested in living in, and a profile of each of the suites/hallways that a user can click on. The profiles of suites and hallways might contain information like how loud the suite is, and whether they are planning on partying. Additionally, a user can navigate between dorms and floors using the buttons on the bottom left corner.
              </p>
              <p>
              As we design the tool, we will be reaching out to past members of the Room Draw Committee and students who have participated in Room Draw to better understand their pain points with the current system. In conversations with participants, we will learn how students currently approach room draw and how our project could address their concerns.
              </p>
              <p>
              Our target users are all around us, and we can collect stories and frustrations in person and through anonymous surveys.
              </p>
              <p>
              The Derecho team includes students who have been room draw participants and one who has been a member of the Room Draw Committee. We have access to two cars which could allow us to interview students and administrators at other schools with different Room Draw systems and policies.
              </p>
              <p>
              Our team consists of two people who have experience in web app creation, Austin and Tenzin, and two people who would like to learn how to build web apps, Ian and Sophia. Since Ian and Sophia would both like experience with building web apps, the two of them will lead the software portion of this project. Austin and Tenzin both would like focus more on the design portion of this project and will lead that effort. That being said, everybody will be involved in each portion of the project, but two team members will lead each portion of the project.

                <h4>Pin Boards (Austin)</h4>
                The pin boards are the current formal medium for communicating preferred double and suite preference. By physically placing pins students can make their intents clear and they make the spacial arrangement of rooms readily apparent. The flaws of this system serve as equally if not stronger inspiration. The boards are hosted on the second floor of the CC. This leads to both infrequent updating of the boards and a latency between them being updating and that information being disseminated.

                <h4>C to Python Transition (Austin)</h4>
                C is a powerful but low level programming that requires programmers to keep track of memory and other values in ways that can be unintuitive. Python is a higher level language that sacrifices speed for easing of writing. Transitioning from writing C to writing Python, everything makes total sense immediately and programmers feel empowered by the speed at which they can fly through code that use to take much longer to write. We want moving from the old room draw process to ours to feel similarly liberating.

                Google Plus uses “circles” to organize and label groups of friends. While very different from a social network, our product could use a similar interface to organize students into suites and doubles and make students’ rooming intentions clear. Students in circles representing suites could start discussions together to decide whether to invite other members to the suite and consider the suite’s location.

                Many room draw conversations currently occur over email, and we believe that the written records provided by email are useful in the room draw process; however, email communication can be slow, and it can be difficult to describe hallway culture or a particular dorm location. Email inspired us to make our product better than email.

                In high stakes rooming discussions, students want to talk to each other quickly without having to wait for a face to face interaction. Facebook’s personal messaging system allows for groups to communicate quickly and easily. Within seconds, a user can add the relevant people to a discussion and start sending messages. Our product ought to support some type of multi-student communication tool to facilitate rooming discussions.

                <h4>Stack Overflow (Sophia)</h4>
                We are inspired by stackoverflow (and generally all of the stackexchange collection of websites) because of the low barrier to information that it enables. If someone has a question about code, or anything else for that matter, they can likely look up the answer on stackoverflow, or a sister site. If they cannot find the answer to the question, then they can simply ask the question, and it will be often be answered relatively quickly by people who are genuinely trying to help others who might know less than they do. Although there are occasionally people who are mean, stackoverflow very much encourages people helping each other.
                </br></br>
                We would like to have the same low barrier to information in our tool. We want it to be as easy to find any information about where people are living and the possible hallway culture as it is to find any information about a bug on stackoverflow. Additionally, while we cannot prevent people from being mean to each other during the room draw process,we would like to encourage the same helpful, collaborative spirit in our tool.

                Currently, this is one of the methods of communication that Olin students use to help facilitate the planning of room draw. Although this spreadsheet is typically used mostly to plan who people are living with, some groups, especially those in suites also use to figure out who has expressed a preliminary interest in living where and what culture each suite might be thinking about having. We want to make sure that our room draw tool facilitates the same initial expression of interest in suites, especially multiple possible locations as is enabled in this spreadsheet.

                When checking in for a flight, some airlines allow you to choose your seat on the airplane. The interface is not cluttered, and it is clear what seats have special qualities, like being an exit row or a seat with more leg room. In our room draw tool, we want it to be just as easy to see qualities, like loudness, of a hallway as it is to tell information about a particular seat in the airline check in process.

Currently, during the room draw process, people use many different means of communication, including, email, face-to-face, and pin boards, among others. We want our tool to reduce the different mediums of communication that people use to communicate about room draw and have them in one, consolidated place.

                </br></br>
                Currently, there are instances where students were unaware of the culture of people they would be living close to until after the room draw processes. We hope to resolve misunderstandings and disputes caused by incompatibility of people within a hallway or floor by allowing our users to be aware of their peers’ preferences before the final room selection.

We will facilitate people to have the privacy of face-to-face communications with our tool by allowing our users to choose to only chat with certain people and since we believe that this method of communication is an essential component of the room draw process, we hope that our tool will encourage people to have more face-to-face communications by making them aware of students who have the same preferences as them.

                Like wikipedia, majority of the content of our product will be produced by the users. The users of our product will be the ones who provide information about their interests in where they want to live and the kind of hallway culture they want. They are also the ones who will be using the information on the site to influence their final decision on the room draw process. While wikipedia is the first site people generally think of visiting to find information on any topic, we hope that our product will be a place where students will visit to find any information information on the site to influence their final decision on the room draw process.

                iPhones are generally easier to use and the user interface is more intuitive than android phones. Though Iphones have multiple features and users also demand more features, one of Apple’s main goal is to create products that customers can learn by themselves and they managed to keep the Iphone interface largely simple, which has contributed to the product’s popularity. While our tool will include multiple features to facilitate a smoother room draw process, one of our main objective is to ensure that students will find our product easy to use.

              <h4>Needs Analysis</h4>

              <h5>The Problem</h5>

              <p>
                What does it mean for something to be “Olin-esque?” If one were to ask Oliners, one would hear many different answers to this question. Some students will quote the Honor Code while others cite their experiences in class, but consistently, the Olin community values cooperation, communication, and respect for others.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every year, our current process for assigning students to dorm rooms invites students to abandon one or more of these values. We call this process Room Draw. In such a close knit community, students care deeply about who they will be rooming with and near. Students look forward to planning suites and hallways with their friends around a certain culture or theme, and they get emotionally attached to plans and potential futures. This high stress situation makes communicating intentions absolutely critical.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a elegant and intuitive communication tool, our project aims to encourage collaboration by early communication. Through better communication, student can better understand each other’s intentions and resolve potential conflicts in a respectful and thoughtful way.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the room draw process, we have identified three different stages: people deciding who they want to room with within a suite or double, people deciding who they are living with, and finally the stage where everything becomes official, and student life is in charge of placing remaining stragglers. A diagram of these stages can be seen below:
              </p>
            </div>

              <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-shadow--2dp" style="margin:20px 0 30px 0;">
                <img src="images/three_phases.jpg" width="100%"/>
              </div>

            <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">
              <p>
                Of these three stages, we are focusing on the second stage -- where students decide where they are living. In this stage, students generally know who their room/suitemates are, but have not finalized a dorm, hallway, or room. We have chosen this stage of the room draw process because in the first stage, many of the conversations can, and do, happen offline. In the second stage, however, we have the opportunity to make communication more open and have lower latency. Conversations about culture and where people are interested in living concern multiple suites and doubles, and we would like to provide a communication and planning tool to facilitate these conversations.
              </p>

              <h4>Who Matters</h4>

              <p>
                Although students at many campuses participate in room draw, we have elected not to make a room draw tool that aims to work for many different universities. There are multiple reasons that we have made this decision. The first reason is that room draw policies vary for every institution, and Olin’s room draw policy is very unique. At Wellesley and Harvey Mudd, for example all students or groups of students that are planning on living together receive a distinct rank, or order for their room draw process. In other words, every group of students knows exactly which other students outrank them and which they outrank. In this case, there is less room for communication -- people are not likely to compromise and communicate if they know immediately which person could take a contested room because of their rank. On the other hand, at Olin, room draw ranking is puts doubles and suites into groups where no double or suite knows the ranking of all the people within that group. This is possible because of Olin’s small size; at any larger school this would be a logistical nightmare. In Olin’s case, where there is no apparent winner for a contested space, communication and compromise are encouraged and required. While a planning tool that better enables communication for room draw might not be useless at an institution where the room draw policy does not encourage communication and compromise, the tool we plan to build would certainly be more useful at an institution like Olin. 
              </p>
              <a href="images/current_process.jpg">
                <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp float-image">
                  <img src="images/current_process.jpg" width="400px"/>
                </div>
              </a>
              <p>
                Additionally, at many other schools, the room draw process is very condensed -- while Olin’s room draw process lasts for months. At other schools, there is simply not enough time for the conversations that our tool would enable to play out. At these institutions, after rankings are assigned and students are told which residence hall they are living in (often decided by student life administrators using a combination of students’ class year, previous residence hall and space left in the desired residence hall) there is one night where students can select the room they are living in. Before this night, unlike at Olin, it is not expected that a preference for a specific room is made public. In fact, at some schools, some rooms or residence halls are so much prefered that students scheme to get themselves and their friends into a specific hall or room. In cases like these communication is very much discouraged. In this case, a tool for making room draw a more communication friendly process would be entirely unhelpful, and designing a communication tool for such a case would be a waste of time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, we have heard in our conversations with students from different schools that their dorm culture is somewhat equivalent to our hallway culture. This means that, at another school, living in the “right” dorm is much more important than living the the “right” room or hallway within that dorm. At Olin, almost the opposite is true -- the dorm does matter, but it is incredibly important for students to be living in the “right” hallway with all their friends. Everything related to room draw at Olin is on a micro scale with many emotions confined to a small space. Here it is easy to blame other people as opposed to the system and this makes a room draw tool customized to Olin valuable.
              </p>
              <p>
                This product will be aimed at Olin students who participate in the room draw process. This excludes Olin students who are R2s as well as those who have not found a suite/room mate before the suite and double selection deadlines. In our conversations around the room draw process, we have found that there are four distinct types of users. 
              </p>
              <ul class="">
                <h5>Hallway Organizer</h5>
                <p>
                  These students are in charge of a group of either suites or doubles. They take on responsibility for organizing and placing groups of students.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the room draw process, hallway bosses are stressed out. They not only have the responsibility of one room or suite during room draw, but sometimes an entire hallway that is focused on living together. This means that they not only have to keep tabs on what other hallway bosses are doing, but also other independents who might have more points than any member of the group they are organizing. Their entire plan can be derailed with one unanticipated pin placement, and hallway bosses are very worried that this will happen in the room draw process.
                </p>

                <h5>Hallway Member</h5>
                <p>
                  These are students that are a part of a larger hallway organization -- a group of friends all planning on living together. These students are just planning on living where their hallway boss tells them to. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the room draw process, sheep are relatively relaxed -- they know that they’ll be living in a hallway with their friends, with the culture that they want, and there’s someone else in charge of organizing this. Although they do care about living with their friends, they also know that someone else is responsible for organizing this.
                </p>

                <h5>Disengaged</h5>
                <p>
                  These people are not engaged in the room draw process at all. They do not care who they are living with and where they are living. They are not a part of a group that wants to live together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the room draw process, laid back independents goes with the flow. They may never lock in a roommate or go through the normal room draw process. As long as they wind up with a room before the semester starts, they are not concerned.
                </p>

                <h5>Passionate Independent</h5>
                <p>
                  These students do care very much about where they are living or the culture of their hallway, but are not a part of a group.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These students may have been kicked out of a hallway group or suite due to size constraints or care strongly about some outside factor. This factors include, but aren’t limited to, proximity to first years, sound, alcohol culture, natural lighting, proximity to friends, distance from enemies, ceiling height, and floor level.
                </p>
              </ul>

              <p>
                In designing this tool, we know that we need to satisfy the passionate independent. This is the person who cares very much about the hallway culture or which hallway are living in, but does not have as many offline avenues to access this information as people who are a part of a group might. The laid back independent can choose not to participate in these conversations, and the sheep and hallway boss can have these conversations offline. It is the person who does not have a group that they are living with, but cares very much about the culture and people in their hallway that needs these communications to happen, or at least be available, online in an accessible place. 
              </p>

              <h4>Requirements</h4>
              <p>
                Rising sophomores, juniors and seniors should be able to use the tool to indicate which rooms they are interested in as well as to gauge other students’ preferences for doubles or suites in East Hall or West Hall.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tool should allow people to view and submit preferences in hallway culture because we found in most of our interviews with our users that hallway culture is an important determinant in the rooms they choose. Currently, there is no easily accessible method for making discussions on hallway culture known and the intent of a certain group of students clear.  Indicating hallway culture will allow users to view and state their lifestyle such as when they prefer to sleep and how loud they are as well as their preferred drinking culture.  They could also share their ideas on activities their hallway can do. We think it is essential that users have the option of not stating their hallway culture because they may not feel comfortable about having others view that information or they may be more laid back in the room draw process and do not care about the culture of the hallway they will be living in. We will need to take care to not force people to be more engaged in the room draw process than they want to be, to ensure that we do not alienate the laid back independents.
              </p>
              <p>
                Private group chats among people who are interested to live in a certain hallway will allow them to have conversations on the kind of hallway they want such as deciding whether people can use the hallway for parties or whether there should be no loud music after a certain time. Those conversations before the actual formation of a hallway, can help determine whether people would want to live in that hallway or not.
              </p>

              <h4>Impact of a Successful Solution</h4>

              <p>
                We realize that the goal of this class is not to make a prototype that actually works, but if we design a successful and approachable user experience, we will make an effort to build a fully functioning prototype of our product.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a world where Oliners use our tool to improve communication around Room Draw, students are rarely surprised to learn of conflicts over rooms. Room Draw no longer causes grudges and stress, and students approach the process confident that the outcome will be agreeable. Every Oliner is invested in making sure their peers are happy where they are rooming, and everyone looks out for eachother.
