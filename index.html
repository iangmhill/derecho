              <h4>Project Brief</h4>
              <p>
              During Room Draw at Olin every year, students become increasingly frustrated with each other and the Room Draw Committee because of poor communication. The current interface for suites and doubles to communicate their intent to room in a certain location is completely physical - students place pins on maps of the dorms. The high activation energy to check for and address conflicts slows communication and causes important conversations to be delayed or brushed under the rug.
              </p>
              <p>
              Hallway culture is a major part of room draw conversations but there is no easily accessible method for making those discussions known and the intent of a certain group of students clear. At present, students can only speculate as to the culture of a hallway based their knowledge of the students planning to live in those hallways.
              </p>
              <p>
              Our project will facilitate earlier, clearer communication for rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors in Olin’s room draw in order to alleviate tensions and prevent miscommunications.
              </p>
              <p>
              A very rough possible implementation of this project can be found in the sketch below.
              </p>
              <div class="mdl-shadow--2dp" style="float: right; margin: 20px 20px;">
                <img src="images/projectbriefsketch.jpg" width="400px"/>
              </div>
              <p>
              In the sketch, there is an interactive map of one floor of the dorm, chats of hallways that the user is interested in living in, and a profile of each of the suites/hallways that a user can click on. The profiles of suites and hallways might contain information like how loud the suite is, and whether they are planning on partying. Additionally, a user can navigate between dorms and floors using the buttons on the bottom left corner.
              </p>
              <p>
              As we design the tool, we will be reaching out to past members of the Room Draw Committee and students who have participated in Room Draw to better understand their pain points with the current system. In conversations with participants, we will learn how students currently approach room draw and how our project could address their concerns.
              </p>
              <p>
              Our target users are all around us, and we can collect stories and frustrations in person and through anonymous surveys.
              </p>
              <p>
              The Derecho team includes students who have been room draw participants and one who has been a member of the Room Draw Committee. We have access to two cars which could allow us to interview students and administrators at other schools with different Room Draw systems and policies.
              </p>
              <p>
              Our team consists of two people who have experience in web app creation, Austin and Tenzin, and two people who would like to learn how to build web apps, Ian and Sophia. Since Ian and Sophia would both like experience with building web apps, the two of them will lead the software portion of this project. Austin and Tenzin both would like focus more on the design portion of this project and will lead that effort. That being said, everybody will be involved in each portion of the project, but two team members will lead each portion of the project.

                <h4>Pin Boards (Austin)</h4>
                The pin boards are the current formal medium for communicating preferred double and suite preference. By physically placing pins students can make their intents clear and they make the spacial arrangement of rooms readily apparent. The flaws of this system serve as equally if not stronger inspiration. The boards are hosted on the second floor of the CC. This leads to both infrequent updating of the boards and a latency between them being updating and that information being disseminated.

                <h4>C to Python Transition (Austin)</h4>
                C is a powerful but low level programming that requires programmers to keep track of memory and other values in ways that can be unintuitive. Python is a higher level language that sacrifices speed for easing of writing. Transitioning from writing C to writing Python, everything makes total sense immediately and programmers feel empowered by the speed at which they can fly through code that use to take much longer to write. We want moving from the old room draw process to ours to feel similarly liberating.

                Google Plus uses “circles” to organize and label groups of friends. While very different from a social network, our product could use a similar interface to organize students into suites and doubles and make students’ rooming intentions clear. Students in circles representing suites could start discussions together to decide whether to invite other members to the suite and consider the suite’s location.

                Many room draw conversations currently occur over email, and we believe that the written records provided by email are useful in the room draw process; however, email communication can be slow, and it can be difficult to describe hallway culture or a particular dorm location. Email inspired us to make our product better than email.

                In high stakes rooming discussions, students want to talk to each other quickly without having to wait for a face to face interaction. Facebook’s personal messaging system allows for groups to communicate quickly and easily. Within seconds, a user can add the relevant people to a discussion and start sending messages. Our product ought to support some type of multi-student communication tool to facilitate rooming discussions.

                <h4>Stack Overflow (Sophia)</h4>
                We are inspired by stackoverflow (and generally all of the stackexchange collection of websites) because of the low barrier to information that it enables. If someone has a question about code, or anything else for that matter, they can likely look up the answer on stackoverflow, or a sister site. If they cannot find the answer to the question, then they can simply ask the question, and it will be often be answered relatively quickly by people who are genuinely trying to help others who might know less than they do. Although there are occasionally people who are mean, stackoverflow very much encourages people helping each other.
                </br></br>
                We would like to have the same low barrier to information in our tool. We want it to be as easy to find any information about where people are living and the possible hallway culture as it is to find any information about a bug on stackoverflow. Additionally, while we cannot prevent people from being mean to each other during the room draw process,we would like to encourage the same helpful, collaborative spirit in our tool.

                Currently, this is one of the methods of communication that Olin students use to help facilitate the planning of room draw. Although this spreadsheet is typically used mostly to plan who people are living with, some groups, especially those in suites also use to figure out who has expressed a preliminary interest in living where and what culture each suite might be thinking about having. We want to make sure that our room draw tool facilitates the same initial expression of interest in suites, especially multiple possible locations as is enabled in this spreadsheet.

                When checking in for a flight, some airlines allow you to choose your seat on the airplane. The interface is not cluttered, and it is clear what seats have special qualities, like being an exit row or a seat with more leg room. In our room draw tool, we want it to be just as easy to see qualities, like loudness, of a hallway as it is to tell information about a particular seat in the airline check in process.

Currently, during the room draw process, people use many different means of communication, including, email, face-to-face, and pin boards, among others. We want our tool to reduce the different mediums of communication that people use to communicate about room draw and have them in one, consolidated place.

                </br></br>
                Currently, there are instances where students were unaware of the culture of people they would be living close to until after the room draw processes.

We will facilitate people to have the privacy of face-to-face communications with our tool by allowing our users to choose to only chat with certain people and since we believe that this method of communication is an essential component of the room draw process, we hope that our tool will encourage people to have more face-to-face communications by making them aware of students who have the same preferences as them.

                <h4>Wikipedia (Tenzin)</h4>
                Like wikipedia, majority of the content of our product will be produced by the users. The users of our product will be the ones who provide information about their interests in where they want to live and the kind of hallway culture they want. They are also the ones who will be using the information on the site to influence their final decision on the room draw process. While wikipedia is the first site people generally think of visiting to find information on any topic, we hope that our product will be a place where students will visit to find any information information on the site to influence their final decision on the room draw process. While wikipedia is the first site people generally think of visiting to find information on any topic, we hope that our product will be a place where students will visit to find any information related to room draw.

                <h4>iPhone (Tenzin)</h4>
                iPhones are generally easier to use and the user interface is more intuitive than android phones. Though Iphones have multiple features and users also demand more features, one of Apple’s main goal is to create products that customers can learn by themselves and they managed to keep the Iphone interface largely simple, which has contributed to the product’s popularity. While our tool will include multiple features to facilitate a smoother room draw process, one of our main objective is to ensure that students will find our product easy to use.

                <h4>Bulletin Board (Tenzin)</h4>
                This is a surface where public messages can be posted. Bulletin boards can be used to announce events, provide information or for advertisements to the public. While we want our tool to allow the users to keep certain conversations private, we need our product to be a place where any user can visit to find more information on the room draw process. Hence, we want our product to be like a bulletin board where information on which our user’s preferences in location and hallway culture is open for any student to view
