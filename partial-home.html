<h2>Project Brief</h2>
</center>
	<p>During Room Draw at Olin every year, students become increasingly frustrated with each other and the Room Draw Committee because of poor communication. The current interface for suites and doubles to communicate their intent to room in a certain location is completely physical - students place pins on maps of the dorms. The high activation energy to check for and address conflicts slows communication and causes important conversations to be delayed or brushed under the rug. </p>

	<p>Hallway culture is a major part of room draw conversations but there is no easily accessible method for making those discussions known and the intent of a certain group of students clear. At present, students can only speculate as to the culture of a hallway based their knowledge of the students planning to live in those hallways. </p>

	<p>Our project will facilitate earlier, clearer communication for rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors in Olinâ€™s room draw in order to alleviate tensions and prevent miscommunications.</p>

	<p>A very rough possible implementation of this project can be found in the sketch below.</p>

	<center>  <img src="images/projectbriefsketch.jpg" style="width:500px;"> </center>

	<p>In the sketch, there is an interactive map of one floor of the dorm, chats of hallways that the user is interested in living in, and a profile of each of the suites/hallways that a user can click on. The profiles of suites and hallways might contain information like how loud the suite is, and whether they are planning on partying. Additionally, a user can navigate between dorms and floors using the buttons on the bottom left corner.</p>

	<p>As we design the tool, we will be reaching out to past members of the Room Draw Committee and students who have participated in Room Draw to better understand their pain points with the current system. In conversations with participants, we will learn how students currently approach room draw and how our project could address their concerns.</p>

	<p>Our target users are all around us, and we can collect stories and frustrations in person and through anonymous surveys.</p>

	<p>The Derecho team includes students who have been room draw participants and one who has been a member of the Room Draw Committee. We have access to two cars which could allow us to interview students and administrators at other schools with different Room Draw systems and policies.</p>

	<p>Our team consists of two people who have experience in web app creation, Austin and Tenzin, and two people who would like to learn how to build web apps, Ian and Sophia. Since Ian and Sophia would both like experience with building web apps, the two of them will lead the software portion of this project. Austin and Tenzin both would like focus more on the design portion of this project and will lead that effort. That being said, everybody will be involved in each portion of the project, but two team members will lead each portion of the project.</p>
